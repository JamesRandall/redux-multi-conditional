# redux-multi-conditional

Conditionally dispatch multiple actions from one action creator

## Installation

    $ npm install redux-multi-conditional

## Usage

Installing the middleware:

```javascript
import multiConditionalMiddleware from 'redux-multi-conditional'
import {createStore, applyMiddleware} from 'redux'

applyMiddleware(multiConditionalMiddleware)(createStore)
```

Using it:

```javascript
import { ConditionalAction } from '../helpers/ConditionalAction.js'

function doSomething () {
  return [
    new ConditionalAction((state) => state.isActive, { type: 'WHEN_ACTIVE' }),
    new ConditionalAction((state,initialState) => state.total != initialState.total, { type: 'TOTAL_CHANGED' }),
    { type: 'ALWAYS_RUN' }
  ]
}
```

This will enumerate the the actions in order dispatching them when the conditional function returns true.
